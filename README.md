The server will start in passive mode listening for a transmission from the client.
The client will then start and contact the server (on a given IP address like 127.0.0.1 and port number).
The client will pass the server a string.
On receiving a string from a client, the server should: 1) reverse all the characters, and 2) reverse the capitalization of the strings.
The server should then send the string back to the client. The client will display the received string and exit.
